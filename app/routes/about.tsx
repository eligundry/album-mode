        Have you ever headed to your Spotify Discover page and found that all
        it's recommendations are albums that you've already heard or ones that
        you aren't interested in? Are you just so tired of hunting for new music
        that you fallback on a reliable favorite? Wouldn't it be nice if you
        were presented a single album and just listened to it, just like back in
        the days of record stores?

        This has been my reality for the past few years. I listen to too much
        music that I've burned through anything good that Spotify could
        recommend to me. Spotify thinks I want more of what I listen to, but, in
        reality, I want music recommendations that I don't know that I'd want or
        even like.

        This is why I built <Link to="/">album-mode.party</Link>. It allows me
        to get a random album based upon a search query (like genre or artist)
        or a random highly rated album from a variety of publications. Since
        I've started using it, the amount of new music I have discovered has
        shot through the roof.
